This is my portfolio site, and I post blogs about tech sometimes.
I am a pre-final year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student. 
I have a keen interest in solving real-life problems by applying cutting-edge technology and skills. 
I am enthusiastic and eager to contribute to team success through hard work, attention to detail, 
and excellent organizational and presentation skills.
